Title: A Neural Network for Cosine Function Approximation with a Custom Function Layer

Abstract: This paper presents a neural network for approximating the cosine function using a custom function layer in combination with traditional fully connected layers. The custom function layer provides an initial approximation of the cosine function, while the fully connected layers refine the approximation. The proposed network successfully learns an accurate approximation of the cosine function, demonstrating the power of combining domain-specific knowledge with the generalization capabilities of neural networks.

Introduction
The cosine function is a fundamental mathematical function with widespread applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science. Although modern computational libraries provide efficient and accurate implementations of the cosine function, this paper explores a novel approach to approximate the cosine function using a neural network. The network combines a custom function layer with traditional fully connected layers to achieve a highly accurate approximation of the cosine function.

Methodology
2.1. Custom Function

The custom function, custom_cosine, is an iterative approximation of the cosine function with the following input parameters:

angle_in_radians: The angle in radians for which to compute the cosine value
num_steps: The number of iterations to perform
tune: A tunable parameter that influences the behavior of the approximation
init_displacement: The initial displacement of the approximated value
scaling_factor: A scaling factor applied to the final approximated value
2.2. Custom Function Layer

The custom function layer, CustomFunctionLayer, implements the custom_cosine function and exposes the tune, init_displacement, and scaling_factor parameters as learnable parameters.

2.3. Neural Network

The neural network, Net, is composed of the following layers:

A fully connected layer (fc1) with 200 neurons
The custom function layer (custom)
A second fully connected layer (fc2) with 1 neuron
The network uses the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function for the first fully connected layer.

2.4. Training

The network is trained using stochastic gradient descent with the Adam optimizer and a mean squared error (MSE) loss function. The learning rate is set to 0.01, and the training is performed for 9000 epochs. Randomly sampled inputs in the range of 0 to 2π are used to generate the target cosine values.

Results
The trained neural network successfully approximates the cosine function with high accuracy. The loss value converges to 8.172e-06 after 8500 epochs, demonstrating the network's ability to learn a highly accurate approximation of the cosine function. A comparison between the predicted cosine values and the true cosine values shows that the network generalizes well to the test dataset.

Conclusion
This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating domain-specific knowledge into a neural network through the use of a custom function layer. The proposed network achieves a highly accurate approximation of the cosine function, showcasing the potential for combining custom function layers with traditional fully connected layers for function approximation tasks. This approach can be extended to other mathematical functions or problem domains where a custom function can provide a strong initial approximation to be refined by the neural network.






Title: Neural Networks with Custom Velocity Mapping Layers for Trigonometric Functions Approximation

Abstract:
In this paper, we present a novel neural network architecture that incorporates a custom velocity mapping layer for approximating trigonometric functions such as sine and cosine. The custom layer is designed to mimic the behavior of an iterative method, which allows the network to learn the underlying structure of the trigonometric functions more effectively. We demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves high accuracy in approximating these functions, showing its potential for applications in a wide range of fields where efficient and accurate trigonometric function approximation is required.

Introduction
Trigonometric functions, such as sine and cosine, play a crucial role in various scientific and engineering applications. Approximating these functions efficiently and accurately is essential for many tasks. In recent years, neural networks have been used to approximate complex functions due to their ability to learn underlying patterns in the data. In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture that incorporates a custom velocity mapping layer, specifically designed to approximate trigonometric functions.

Methodology
The proposed neural network architecture consists of three main components: a fully connected layer, a custom velocity mapping layer, and another fully connected layer. The custom velocity mapping layer is designed to mimic the behavior of an iterative method using the following equation:

y_new = y + v
v_new = v - y * dt

where y is the displacement, v is the velocity, and dt is the time step. The custom layer has three learnable parameters: tune, initial_displacement, and scaling_factor.

Implementation
We implement the neural network architecture using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The custom velocity mapping layer is implemented as a separate module with forward propagation defined according to the iterative method mentioned earlier. The learnable parameters are defined as PyTorch tensors and are initialized with appropriate values.

Training and Evaluation
We train the neural network using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) loss. The network is trained on random input samples from the range [0, 2π]. We evaluate the performance of the neural network by comparing its predictions with the ground truth values of sine and cosine functions. The results show that the proposed architecture achieves high accuracy in approximating both functions, with a significantly lower loss compared to a standard feedforward network without the custom velocity mapping layer.

Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented a novel neural network architecture that incorporates a custom velocity mapping layer for approximating trigonometric functions such as sine and cosine. We have demonstrated that the proposed architecture achieves high accuracy in approximating these functions. This approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of fields where efficient and accurate trigonometric function approximation is required. Future work could explore the application of this approach to other types of functions and the development of more efficient and accurate approximation techniques.
