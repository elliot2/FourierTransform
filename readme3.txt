torch.arange(N, dtype=torch.float32): 
This creates a 1D tensor containing values from 0 to N-1, 
where N is the length of the input signal (in this case, 16). 
The tensor has a shape of (N,).

.unsqueeze(1): This adds an extra dimension to the tensor, 
changing its shape from (N,) to (N, 1). 
This is done to facilitate broadcasting in later calculations.

2 * np.pi * (...) / N: This multiplies the tensor by 2 * np.pi 
and divides the result by N. This scales the tensor values such 
that they are evenly spaced between 0 and 2 * np.pi. 
The result is a tensor representing angular frequencies.

(...) + tune: Finally, the tune parameter is added to the tensor. 
The tune parameter is a learnable parameter in the custom layer, 
which allows the neural network to adjust the angular frequencies 
during training. This can help the network achieve better 
approximations of the Fourier transform.

So, dt is a tensor of shape (N, 1) containing scaled angular 
frequencies plus the learnable tune parameter. 
This tensor is used in the custom Fourier transform 
function to update the y and v variables during each iteration.
